This Open Source mod allows creation of parties and displaying of nametags of party members. There is no party size limit.

Parties are managed by the player. Open the menu (default key: 'P'), and Add players to your party. If they have also added you, then your nametags will automatically appear. Parties are saved, so you don't have to re-create it each time you login. They also work for whatever server runs the mod.

Updates will be published a maximum of once per week, unless there are game-breaking bugs.

You are free to use this mod on your monetized servers. If you repack or use the code in a Derivative Work, you [b]must[/b] include the entire contents of the NOTICE file in a readable place in accordance with the Apache License.
